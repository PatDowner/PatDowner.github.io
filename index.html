                    <p>Hello, my name is Pat Downer. I am currently a student in a coding bootcamp course through University of California Irvine. My goal is to turn this period of coronavirus-induced unemployment into a new career path that capitalizes on my strengths and interests.</p>
                    <p>After graduating from Boston University in 2007 with a bachelors degree in Deaf Studies, I taught math for two years. During those years, I discovered that one of my greatest strengths and interests as a teacher was my ability to utilize technology to create my own classroom materials.</p>
                    <p>In the 10 years since then, most of which I spent working for the textbook company Pearson, I discovered that I enjoy the problem solving of writing formulas and filters to automate certain work tasks. Setting up these automated tasks became my favorite part of my last job. Realizing this was what lead me to decide to seek a career change into the technical field so that these sorts of tasks would become a substantial part of my regular work day.</p>
                    <p>Folllow me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pat-downer-62496715/">my LinkedIn profile</a> and on this site. I can also be reached <a href="mailto:patricia.downer@gmail.com">via email</a>.</p>
