# Responsive Portfolio
## A portfolio website for my work from coding boot camp.

This portfolio is to be used to highlight my work from coding bootcamp and (eventually) beyond. As the course goes on, I can update it with additional content I create, with feedback from career services, and can eventually use this for job hunting.

# Guidelines we were given for assignment
## Directions:

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

* Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

## Hints:

* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.
     > **Note:** I chose to maintain a very small margin on `xs` screens for aesthetic reasons to prevent items from crashing against the side. It does snap closer in `xs` than any other screen size.

## Minimum Requirements:

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.


## Bonus:

* Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).

# My Work

## Structure:

Main elements of my site are heavily styled using Bootstrap components, grid system, and utilities. I dug into the documentation to learn how to use their defined classes to adjust formatting and style in many cases.

On the `portfolio.html` page, the cards for each project are built with a combination of code from the cards in Bootstrap and from the accordion collapse component. If/When a new card is created, remember that the elements of the cards have multiple places where a number (One, Two, Three, etc) is indicated, each card has to have its own number.

> This profile section obviously will need updated with real info to replace the placeholder stuff as I produce more content.

## Style:

A few notes about the styling on the site:

* Color scheme

     * The main blue color used throughout is Bootstrap's *info* color.
     
     * The main yellow color used throughout is Bootstrap's *warning* color.

     * The light blue background color is set to relate to the *info* color and is achieved using opacity.

* Layout

     * Left/right margins = 20px

     * `contact.html` page has sub rows and sub columns.
